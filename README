Anti Aliasing Effect

Descritption
This C code applies the anti aliasing effect on png images which are resized 
by 3 or an even number of times. The code can run on a numerous number of threads.

Getting Started
Simply by compiling the project and giving the right arguments, the code should run
on any linux distribution. The makefile gives one example of running the code on a 
colored pnm image (.png) included in the project.

Prerequisites
The gcc package should be enough.

Run
After compilation(make) execute the following command:
./anti_aliasing "pnm image(ex: test.pnm)" "desired output name(ex: out.pnm)"
	 	"desired resize factor(ex: 3 or even number)" "number of threads(ex: 2)"

Explanation of the code
The structure "image" contains the fields required to create a functional pnm 
image. Variable "P" saves the type of the image ( P5(greyscale), P6(RGB) ),
"width" and "height" save the dimensions of the image, "maxval" defines the 
maximum value which means black, "grey" and "pic" save the values of the 
greyscale/color image.
Function "readInput" reads the input image and saves the header data and 
the core image in local variables.
Function "writeData" writes the resulted image.
Function "resize" calculates the dimensions, allocates the requiered space
and gives each thread its part to process.
Function "threadFunction" checks the type of image (color/greyscale) and 
the resize factor (3 / even) and then processes the image.
